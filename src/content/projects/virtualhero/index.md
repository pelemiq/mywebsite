### Description

Promotional virtual reality experience for the anime series Virtual Hero, based on the Spanish Youtuber ElRubiusOMG.

Additionally, we developed a standalone PC app that allows you to create your own avatar, and store your configuration as a json file.

The project was created for Sitges film festival, originally designed as a two player experience, as you can see in <a target="_blank" aria-label="Official website" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHZfZg1cu3A">this video.</a>

After the film festival, the project was adapted for single player game, and published for free on Steam.
